Welcome to Yiwei's blog! I think there is value in documenting what I learn as I am best positioned to help people one step behind me. In a way, this blog is an avenue for me to organise my thoughts as I seek to explain it to my past self as well as a tool to remind my future self. I hope you find it interesting!
