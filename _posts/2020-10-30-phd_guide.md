# Introduction

As a PhD student or academic, writing is a core element of the job. In order to succeed, you need to be a productive writer. However, completing a PhD is by no means easy and I can attest to some of the self-sabotaging behaviours that will be mentioned in this post. Half of the reason I wrote this is to summarise a bunch of tips I've come across for my future self because I know I will need to be reminded of them. The other half is to put this out for other PhD students and academics in the hopes it is useful. 



# What Writing Is Not
Writing isn’t editing: you should not spend
your brief snack-writing time trying to find
the perfect word or getting your grammar
right. Writing isn’t reading journal articles for
research: write first and read afterwards, so
that your writing shows you what you need
to read. Writing isn’t referencing: when you
make that killer argument and want to reference Smith and Brown (2006; or maybe it
was 2007?), don’t stop and look it up. Write
“Smith & Brown (200??)” and keep going.
You can look up the reference later. Furthermore, writing is not formatting, literature
searching, photocopying, e-mailing or
nosing around on Facebook. Writing — at
least for your snack-writing sessions —
means putting new words on the page or
substantially rewriting existing words. 


Sometimes people think they should write when they are "ready" and need to read endlessly or conduct more experiments. Ironically, this makes them less likely to write and more confused. And sometimes people think they should understand the material first and then write but in practice, after writing, they find that there were inconsistencies and certain parts didn't flow well - signs that they didn't understand the material coherently in the first place. According to this [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7354-129a),
> In fact, writing clarifies your thinking. Writing is not recording - you don't just take a photocopy of what is in your head and put it on the page. It is a far more creative and interactive process. As you write, you develop your thoughts. Writing is, in fact, rigorous thinking. Writing means putting new words on the page or substantially rewriting old words.



# Self-Sabotaging Behaviours

## Perfectionism
> Setting unrealistic and impossible expectations

## Procrastination
> Putting off important or necessary tasks, often until the last minute

## Disorganisation
> Not developing a routine or system that makes managing your time and life easier

## Not Putting in Effort
> Not practising or trying very hard

## Choosing Performace Debilitating Circumstances
> Trying to work in a busy or unsuitable location or situation






# Prepare Yourself To Write
## Ergonomics

This tip was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.fast.ai/2020/08/06/ergonomics/).

If you are feeling uncomfortable, then you are certainly not going to feel comfortable writing for extended periods of time. You don't want to damage your neck, back, arms by having poor posture. Ideally, you want your screen at approximately eye height to prevent straining the neck and this pretty much means raising your monitor if you haven't already. Using textbooks, pads of paper, or boxes is cheap way to do so. For those who use a laptop, you can raise your display and use a separate keyboard and mouse. If you don't have a dedicated office space and need to move your workstation around, you use a box to raise your laptop screen and use it to store your keyboard and mouse as you move. You can even use your rolled up backpack in replacement of said box. For the keyboard, you want your elbows approximately perpendicular to your torso as you type.

I've used the large boxes Amazon ships me to make a standing desk setup. Standing can become uncomfortable after a long time so I find it helpful to transition between standing an sitting every so often. 

Being uncomfortable will distract you from writing so consider how this might work for you. You don't need an expensive motorised table, fancy laptop stands, etc to get started. 



## Touch Typing

You will spend hours... days... years typing so it's definitely worth your time learning how to touch type. It also helps with ergonomics since you don't need to look at your keyboard anymore. A good typist can get over 100 words per minute but in practice, unless you are transcribing, you don't need to be this fast. I find it good enough to type at thought speed. 
I trained by going through a dictionary and typing *many* words but you can train in other ways. For example, those playing fast paced online multiplayer games get really good at typing to communicate with team members and asking for assistance as the situation calls for it. 

As a side note, I don't remember what some of my passwords are because it's in muscle memory! My fingers know what it is and to work it out (say if I needed the password on my phone), I have to visualise a keyboard and play back where my fingers go. 

It's bizzare that I still see academics hunt and peck as they type. For a job that requires writing papers and answering many emails, I think it's definitely a good investment to increase your typing speed. 



## Back Up Your Work Regularly and Use Version Control

I remember a day in the past, I lost a day of work because I forgot to save a Word document. I was devestated for about 10 minutes before smashing the report out again because it was due that day. That was stressful! You don't want this to happen to you when writing your thesis so back up your work regularly.

I now use Overleaf to write my reports/papers and it saves *as you type* so you don't lose a second of work. It's the Google Docs for LaTeX and also integrates with git for version control. 

For software projects, I use GitHub and this is great for text files (since you check a diff for every commit) but also works for saving binary files. The advantage of using a version control system is the ability to roll back changes, and try experiments in a separate branch before merging with the master branch. This is great for collaboration where your team may be working on the same code base but separate modules.

# Get Into The Groove

## Binge Writing or Snack Writing

When possible,
try snack writing first thing in the morning.
Our experience suggests that this increases the
chances of success by minimizing distractions
and ensuring that you have sufficient energy to
write clever things. However, for snack writing
to lead to really high-quality results, you also
need to write in a very specific way. 

Big blocks hardly ever come, and when they do, usually not get used productively. 
and that research shows that getting into the habit of writing regularly in small chunks (as Gardiner and Kearns calls "snack writing") increases productivity.


## ABCDEs of writing








# Form A Writing Group

Inspired by [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) (which is short for National Novel Writing Month), I created a writing group with a few friends also doing their PhD. I you don't know what NaNoWriMo is, here is the [description from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month)
> National Novel Writing Month is an annual Internet-based creative writing project that takes place during the month of November. Participants attempt to write a 50,000-word manuscript between November 1 and November 30. 

Writing with others creates some accountability and with the mutual encouragement, it should also help you put words down no matter if it's good or not. To start, I would recommend to go for a smaller goal like 100 words/day so by the end of the month, you will have 3000 more words that you never had before. 

When starting a writing group, I need to stress it is *not* a competition (that is a *scarcity* mindset which is founded on the idea that if someone is successful, it means you lose). You should instead have a *abundance* mindset - that is there are enough resources and successes for everyone so you can celebrate the success of others. It is worth a segway to take a look at Stephen Covey's [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) and apply some of the *interdependence* tips to your writing group. 

## Segway: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
In summary, there are three stages of increasing maturity: dependence, independence, and interdependence - and the 7 habits are designed to get you to interdependence and being good leaders and team players that can combine talents. 

### Dependence $\rightarrow$ Independence

1. Don't be reactive. Be proactive. 
2. Begin with the end in mind. Don't just act, thinking first about the end goal and consequences as you plan towards you goal.
3. First things first. Do what is important first. 

You can categorise tasks into four quadrants shown in this image:
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/7_habits_decision-making_matrix.png ""){:width="50%"}.

- Quadrant I. Urgent and important (Do) - important deadlines: crises, deadline driven projects, meetings, and preparations
- Quadrant II. Not urgent but important (Plan) - long term development: prevention, value clarification, relationship building, empowerment
- Quadrant III. Urgent but not important (Delegate) - distractions with deadlines: interruptions, some phone calls, some emails and reports, some meetings
- Quadrant IV. Not urgent and not important (Eliminate) - frivolous distractions: trivia, junk email, some phone calls, time wasters, "escape" activities

The ideal quadrant to work in is II. That means starting on papers and assignments early and minimising time spent on distractions. As a PhD student, you are often delegated tutoring roles by lecturers and while you can learn a lot about communicating ideas and gauging understanding while solidifying your own understanding, know that it can be a distraction. So if money is not an issue, it is up to your own judgement as to what works for you - remember habit 2: begin with the end in mind. 

### Independence $\rightarrow$ Interdependence

4. Think Win-Win. See mutually beneficial solutions.
5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood.
6. Synergise. Combine people's strength through positive teamwork and achieve goals that would not be attainable if done alone. 

### Continual Improvement
The final habit is to
7. Sharpen the Saw; Growth: Learn, commit, do.
> Balance and renew your resources, energy and health to create a sustainable, long-term, effective lifestyle. 


# Solving The Issue Of Being Unsure Of What To Write

## Rubber Duck Debugging
If you find yourself stuck on how to write a certain section, try [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Instead of trying to debug code, you are trying to debug your sentences. The essence of rubber duck debugging is to force yourself to explain the problem to someone else (in this case an inanimate rubber duck) and in the process, find a solution. 
 or facing a difficult problem

## Thinking Walks
When you still feel stuck after a session of rubber duck debugging, try going on a short walk and let your subconcious do the work in the background. 


## Run a Series of Seminars on the P
This is trick that some professors do.

## Prolific Writers and Updating Readers/Supervisors

I like reading fantasy with well throught out magic systems and if we're talking about prolific writers, one author to aspire to is Brandon Sanderson. This man is a machine and many of his fans joke that he's cloned himself or is a robot because the sheer amount of well written output (and does a weekly postcast, updates fans on social media, goes on writing tours, and teaches a writing class at BYU). If you check out his [website](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/), he has *progress bars* for his works which is updated regularly! If you like fantasy, be sure to check this author out at the risk of being so engrossed by the story you spend the whole week reading instead of writing...

> Warning: Patrick Rothfuss has some of the best writing I've ever read but the third book in the trilogy is no where near completion and, at the time of writing this blog post, I've been waiting 9 years since book 2 was published with no updates on progress - [not even his editor knows](https://www.newsweek.com/kingkiller-chronicle-editor-believes-author-hasnt-written-anything-years-1520812). Do *not* do this to your supervisor! You do not have the same luxury as a PhD student or academic. 

If you are avoiding your supervisor(s) when they are asking for a draft chapter, that is a sure sign you're in deep waters. 


## Writing Excuses Podcast

I found this podcast on writing after following one of my favourite authors who is one of the hosts. From the [homepage](https://writingexcuses.com/about-2/about/)
> Writing Excuses is a fast-paced, educational podcast for writers, by writers.

Although most of the content revolves around writing fiction, many of writing tips and writing prompts are great to get you thinking and motivate you to write. Great for something to listen during your commute. 

I hope you enjoyed reading this and found it useful. To close, I will end on the same injuction used in Writing Excuses:

***"You're out of excuses. Now go write."***
