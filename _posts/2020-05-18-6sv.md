# Introduction

In this blog post, I will cover the basics from the [6SV2.1 manual](http://6s.ltdri.org/pages/manual.html). 6S stands for " **S**econd **S**imulation of a **S**atellite **S**ignal in the **S**olar **S**pectrum" and the V stands for *vectorised* meaning the polarisation of light is taken to account. This radiative transfer (RT) code is used to correct for atmospheric absorption and scattering. It also enables[^1]:

- accurate simulations of satellite and UAV observations,
- accounts for elevated targets,
- models a realistic atmospheric with aerosols and other molecules,
- and use of Lambertian and anisotropic ground surfaces.

According to Vermote *et al.*, it is "one of the most widely used, rigorously validated, and heavily documented RT codes known in the scientific remote-sensing community." Version 1 of the 6S code appeared in 1997 and now in the new version 2.1 release in 2015, it uses the method of successive orders of scattering for more accurate approximations that were previously too computationally taxing on old hardware. The code is written in Fortran which is very common for scientific libraries where speed is of primary concern.
