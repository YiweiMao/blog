    "> Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic lighting effects. Essentially, an algorithm can trace the path of light, and then simulate the way that the light interacts with the virtual objects it ultimately hits in the computer-generated world.

    "This blog post was made entirely in a Jupyter Notebook so you can download it (link to GitHub at top of post) and run it for yourself. I chose to write in Julia as opposed to Python for a number of reasons:\n",
    "- Julia is compiled and runs as almost as fast as C\n",
    "- Interactive and can be used in a Jupyter Notebook (the Ju in Jupyter stands for Julia)\n",
    "- Supports mathematical symbols in code\n",
    "- Rather similar to use for someone used to `numpy`\n",
    "- I'm learning Julia right now and the best way to learn a new programming language is to use it!\n",
