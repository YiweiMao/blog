    "Ping pong balls are great light diffusers and combining them with individually addressable RGB LEDs makes for a pretty display. This ping pong clock can show the time and background animations (more on that later). Since each \"pixel\" is placed in a hexagonal close packed (single layer though), the typical digits font for standard 7-segement displays can't be used unless the digits are slanted. \n",

    "# Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "I ordered all the materials to build this well before the global pandemic but only got to making it recently. The ping pong balls and LED strip took many weeks to arrive shipping from overseas. \n",
    "\n",
    "- At least 128 ping pong balls. I used low cost \"glossy\" plasticky ping pong balls ~$20. Better to use proper ping pong balls that diffuse the light well.\n",
    "- 5 m of WS2128B LED strip at 30 LEDS/m. (This gives you 150 RGB LEDS which is more than the required 128. ~$20)\n",
    "- 2 m of 3pin wire ~$3. You can use single connection multicore wire as an alternative. \n",
    "- Some lead-free solder ~$2. Any solder will do really. \n",
    "- Microcontroller (I used an Arduino Nano Clone ~$3. Not enough RAM for scrolling text animations so consider an ESP32 board?) \n",
    "- A Real Time Clock with coin cell battery. I didn't have one so I used a software implementation instead. That meant I couldn't keep track of the right time after a powerdown. But hey, a broken clock is right twice a day!\n",
    "- MDF board to put all LEDs onto ~$4.\n",
    "- Wood Frame ~$5. You will need a miter saw to cut the frame at 60 degree angles.\n",
    "- Some screws/nails/epoxy to fit the frame together ~$1.\n",
    "- Lots of hot glue. I used a 30 cm stick ~$1.\n",
    "- A 5 V power supply. I'm using a phone charger which can provide up to 2 A of current. If you plan to turn all the LEDs to max brightness, you'll need like 8 A but for all intents and purposes, I think 2 A is enough. You can use a `FastLED` setting to set a limit to the power draw and the brightness will automatically adjust for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [original instructable](https://www.instructables.com/Ping-Pong-Ball-LED-Clock/) which describes how to build and program the LED clock is a great resource so definitely take a look! In it, he/she uses competition quality ping pong balls rather than the cheap ones I used which tended to be glossy and inconsistent in the amount of plastic for each ball. I'm inclined to agree that the higher quality ping pong balls are way better despite being more costly. The cheap plasticky ping pong balls don't diffuse the light enough and the LED position can seen from behind. If you do choose to use the cheap ping pong balls however, I found that you can recreate the really great light diffusion by *stacking* two cut halves together. Looking from afar, I can't notice any blemishes (or at least, my mind won't let me). \n",

    "each ball goes into a jig I made using LEGO to hold the ball in place while I used an X-acto knife to slice along the seam. If you don't slice along the seam, you can see the seam when you shine the LED behind it! This is the most tedious part and took me a whole day.\n",

    "![](../images/2021-01-05-LED_clock_files/jig.png \"Figure 3: Jig to slice each ping pong ball along the visible seam.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "I then used hot glue to double stack each half to improve the diffusion. Once the improved halves are done, I glued two together while aligning it to a flat surface (edge of a tissue box in my case). The instructable used two long lengths of wood to ensure each row is straight - it's impossible to mess up the straight line gluing two pieces together. Then extend to the final shape shown in Figure 6 (2 rows of 17, 2 rows of 18, 2 rows of 19 and 1 row of 20). I used hot glue quite liberally to make the structure rigid but it still ended up rather fragile - not a problem once it's in the frame and glued down. \n",

    "![](../images/2021-01-05-LED_clock_files/glued.png \"Figure 4: Used hot glue to stick halves together.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "I cut the LED strips such that the included JST connector both starts and ends the whole thing and these connectors are pulled through a 12 mm diameter hole. This means you can provide 5 V power from both ends. I follwed the wiring shown in Figure 8. Keep in mind the direction shown on the strip! I found that the wiring wasn't noticible after the ping pong balls were placed so didn't bother putting them behind the MDF board like the instructable. Sticky tape was used to temporarilly fix the strip positions while I test for light leakage after placing the ping pong balls on top. \n",

    "The reason why I'm not providing exact dimensions for the frame is that the dimensions will depend on how well you glue all the ping pong ball pieced together. Since each ping pong ball was 40 mm diameter, the row of 20 should be 800 mm long but mine ended up being 810 mm. With the frame, the overall dimensions was roughly 850 mm long and 290 mm tall. \n",

After connecting 5 V and GND, the remaining data pin can be connected to any digital pin (I used pin 6). This made the hardware really easy to interface and minimsed mistakes with soldering and wiring. (Imagine controlling all the LEDs with its own digital pin!) \n",

    "\n",
    "Updating this frame buffer does not update the LEDs until you call `FastLED.show()`. Before writing to the frame buffer, I first use `FastLED.clear()` to zero all the LEDs to `CRGB::Black`.\n",

    "You can also use the HSV colour space and set the hue, saturation, and value using `CHSV(unit8_t hue,unit8_t sat,unit8_t val)` which will automatically convert to an RGB value to be stored. `FastLED` has two rainbow spectrums - I used the default which spaces out the oranges and yellows more and is visually more \"rainbow-like\". \n",
    "\n",
    "### Power consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Each RGB LED can draw 60 mA and since there are 128 of them, that's 7.68 A. In all my applications, I do not need to turn all the LEDs white on max brightness anyway. I found full brightness too bright and that even half brightness is good enough. I used a 5 V, 2 A phone charger. `FastLED` provides as function to limit the power consumption automatically so that LED brightnesses are modified before writing out the frame buffer. This means you can code your animations assuming full power while testing on a smaller power supply, then change a setting for deployment. \n",

    "### Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "Each RGB LED takes around 30 us to be written. To update the whole clock display, the whole process takes 3.84 ms. Theoretically, that means the max refresh rate is 260 Hz but it takes time to clear the frame buffer, cycle through the look up table, compute colour values and write the new animations. In practice, I found a 20 Hz refresh rate was plenty for smooth animations. \n",
