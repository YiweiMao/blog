    "# Introduction\n",
    "The atmosphere is all nice and necessary for daily life, but it sure does make it tricky to obtain picture perfect hyperspectral images taken by satellites. While we shake our fist at refraction, scattering, and absorption corrupting our data, we are simultaneously amazed at the blue sky produced by the same effects and make it a common theme in desktop wallpapers. We can't blame all our inadequacies on atmospheric effects though. Hyperspectral images also contain sensor errors such as striping, and smile and keystone artefacts which need correcting. These correction procedures require models as we shall see towards the end of this blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be some referencecs to Hyperion data so let's understand that. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperion Data\n",
    "Hyperion is the first satellite hyperspectral imager on the Earth Observing-1 [(EO-1 Satellite)](http://eo1.gsfc.nasa.gov). This satellite was part of NASA's New Millennium Program Earth Observing series and sat in a sun-synchronous orbit{% fn 1 %}. The hyperspectral sensor had 220 spectral bands and a spatial resolution of 30 m. The images are taken via pushbroom which means stripes (with 7.5 km swath width in the case of Hyperion) are taken sequentially to build a 2D image with 220 channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperion data is taken above the atmosphere so it will be affected by the atmosphere. "

    "# Atmospheric Effects\n",
    "The atmosphere contains molecules such as water, carbon dioxide, ozone, and aerosols. These impede the path that light takes from the scene towards the imaging sensor. The major effects of the atmosphere are: refraction, scattering, and absorption.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refraction\n",
    "Refraction is the bending of light as it enters a medium with a different refractive index. It is refraction that makes a straw appear bent in a glass of water. Every medium has a refractive index $n$ defined as\n",
    "$$ n = c/v $$\n",
    "where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $v$ is the speed of light in the medium. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: When $n$ also depends on the wavelength $\\lambda$, we also get dispersion. Refractive index is also defined as $n =\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r}$ where $\\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the medium. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can predict the refracted light angle $\\theta_2$ knowing the refractive indicies of two mediums $n_1,n_2$ and incident angle $\\theta_1$ by Snell's law\n",
    "$$ n_1 \\sin\\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin\\theta_2 .$$\n",
    "This procedure can be repeated as light moves into denser (and higher refractive index) regions of the atmosphere as shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/2020-04-27-basics_of_radiometric_correction_files/refraction.png \"Figure 1: Light path through atmosphere with refraction effects exaggerated{% fn 2 %}.\"){:width=\"80%\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scattering\n",
    "Atmospheric scatter is caused by many diffuse reflections of light off particles in the air. There are three regimes for scattering: Rayleigh, Mie, and optical depending on the ratio between the incident light wavelength and particle size. Rayleigh when the wavelength $\\lambda$ is much smaller than the particle size $d$, optical when the wavelength is much larger than the particle size, and Mie inbetween Rayleigh and optical where there are resonances $0.1 < \\lambda/d < 10$. This is aptly described in Figure 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/2020-04-27-basics_of_radiometric_correction_files/scattering.png \"Figure 2: Scattering regimes{% fn 3 %}.\"){:width=\"80%\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming Rayleigh scattering, the intensity $I$ of light scattered is given by\n",
    "$$ I = I_0\\frac{1+\\cos^2\\theta}{2R^2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{n^2-1}{n^2+2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^6  $$\n",
    "where $I_0$ is the original intensity, $\\theta$ is the scattering angle, and $R$ is the range to the distance to the particle (Seinfeld and Pandis 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatter cross section $\\sigma_s$, after averaging over all scatter angles (Cox et al. 2002), is given by\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_s = \\frac{2\\pi^5 d^6}{3\\lambda^4} \\left(\\frac{n^2-1}{n^2+2}\\right)^2 .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also this relation with the polarisability $\\alpha$ given by (Blue Sky 2015)\n",
    "$$ I = I_0 \\frac{8\\pi^4 \\alpha^2}{\\lambda^4 R^2}(1+\\cos^2\\theta) .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Shorter wavelengths are scattered more as can be seen by the $\\lambda^{-4}$ dependence so when we look at the sky on a sunny day, we can see more of the shorter wavelength blue light compared to red light. However, if there is heavy air pollution (possibly from bushfires), blue light is scattered away leaving the red light. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Atmospheric Absorption\n",
    "According to Gao et al. (2009), eight gases in the atmosphere have measureable absorption effects for hyperspectral imagers in the wavelength range 400--3000 nm with spectral resolution 1--20 nm. These gases are: water vapour H$_2$O, carbon dioxide CO$_2$, ozone O$_3$, nitrous oxide N$_2$O, carbon monoxide CO, methane CH$_4$, oxygen O$_2$, and nitrogen dioxide NO$_2$. Water is by far the most absorbing and this is illustrated in Figure 3. \n",

    "Attenuation coefficient $\\tau$ and extinction coefficient $\\alpha$\n",
    "$$ \\tau_\\lambda(z) = \\int_0^z \\alpha(\\lambda,z) dz $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T(z,\\theta) = e^{-\\tau_\\lambda(z)/\\cos\\theta} $$\n",
    "where $\\tau_\\lambda$ consists of the contributions from Rayleigh scattering, and absorption from water and ozone. \n",
    "$\\cos\\theta$ accounts for oblique view.\n",
